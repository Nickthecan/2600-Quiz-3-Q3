/*Question 3 : Number guessing game 
Create an interactive program that allows a user to guess a number between 1-10. You 
should create a menu that will have options (this should be displayed on the screen):
Press 1 to play a game
Press 2 to change the max number
Press 3 to quit
If option 1 is selected the program should prompt the user to enter a number. 
If the user is correct tell them they won then the program should go back to the menu. 
Otherwise tell them if they were too low or high in there guess and allow them to guess 
again. This should continue until they win. If they enter q instead of a number when 
prompted the game should end(NOT the program) and return to the menu.
If option 2 is chosen, then tell them the max value they can set the number. Make sure 
they do not enter a negative number or go above the max value.
If option 3 is chosen thank the user for playing and end the game.
Now create a new branch â€“ call it save_user_max_number
Can you save the users request for the max number where the program is able to 
remember it the next time it starts?
*/

/* Outline
Create a switch case to display the 3 options
When option 1 is selected, we will use the scan function in order to allow the user to enter a number
Then we will throw the number in a if else statement to determine whether the number is greater than or lesser than the given number
This will go into a do while loop so the user can keep guessing until they can guess the number correctly
When the user enters q, then it should jump out of the while loop and go back to the main menu
When option 2 is selected, the user can set the max number, the set number will change to that new number
We will checkIntegrity and checkMaximum in order to see if the number is valid
When option 3 is chosen, the game will quit
